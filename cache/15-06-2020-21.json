Photo: Melati Citrewireja<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Although many of us are turning to takeout for comfort during these trying times, we&#8217;ve all had that disappointing moment of really bad to-go food. A container that holds once-crisp french fries, now steamed and soggy. Or dishes that should be eaten piping hot arriving lukewarm, or worst yet, cold and congealed. Nosh consulted with East Bay chefs and restaurateurs<b> <\/b>to learn how to make the most of the takeout experience.<\/p>\n<p>Kristen Davis, owner of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2018\/07\/06\/berkeley-reopening-kcs-bbq\">KC\u2019s BBQ<\/a> in Berkeley, does a brisk takeout business. Her number one tip: \u201cGet to the restaurant just as the food is being boxed up and get home fast.\u201d The longer the wait before consuming the food, the more likely it will lose its flavor.<\/p>\n<p>Another suggestion: \u201cIf you can, keep your car heater on. It will act as a warmer on the way home,\u201d Davis said. Obviously, this only applies to hot foods. If you can, transport items like cold drinks in a separate container.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, neither Davis nor any of the other restaurateurs surveyed had a hack for keeping fries crispy.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pullquote\">\n<p>\u201cKeep your boxes or bags open and enjoy your fries on the way home.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cFries are not something we specialize in, but I do know when anybody makes fries, generally they are best when they are hot out of the fire,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWhen they are put in bags or boxes, they are hot and continue to steam,\u201d causing the dreaded soggy effect.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe easiest way is to keep your boxes or bags open and enjoy your fries on the way home,\u201d Davis said.<\/p>\n<p>Pork ribs are KC\u2019s BBQ\u2019s most popular items. Happily, these and the restaurant\u2019s handcrafted sausage links, made fresh every day, do not suffer during transport, Davis said. The same is true of the barbeque chicken, she said.<\/p>\n<p>Some historians speculate that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2015\/5\/1\/8525335\/burrito-history-invention-america\">burrito was created by vaqueros<\/a> in northern Mexico who rode the trails all day and needed something durable and filling. Now it\u2019s riding to the rescue of East Bay residents sheltering in place during the pandemic, said John Paluska, owner of Comal, the fine-dining restaurant in downtown Berkeley, and Comal Next Door, its fast-casual sister taqueria.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_293893\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 720px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2018\/04\/11\/bites-oyster-bliss-returns-to-kermit-lynch-comal-next-door-update-smokey-js-is-now-catering-only\/26248537337_0fcf6e32cd_h\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-293893\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-293893\" src=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/26248537337_0fcf6e32cd_h-900x601.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"481\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/26248537337_0fcf6e32cd_h-900x601.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/26248537337_0fcf6e32cd_h-200x134.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/26248537337_0fcf6e32cd_h-360x240.jpg 360w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/26248537337_0fcf6e32cd_h-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/26248537337_0fcf6e32cd_h-720x480.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/26248537337_0fcf6e32cd_h-480x320.jpg 480w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/26248537337_0fcf6e32cd_h.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Paluska, owner of Comal and Comal Next Door, says the burrito is the &#8220;ultimate takeout food.&#8221; His tip: reheat and crisp up a cold burrito in a cast-iron pan.

Police officers do get tired, too, and the Berkeley police have been experiencing a certain amount of unrelenting, generalized, harsh and often unfair criticism since the murder of George Floyd. I, for one, hope that we could tolerate a few blunt words.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don\u2019t think the chief should apologize for stating the truth,&#8221; wrote another commentator. &#8220;If you take away less-lethal response you are left with lethal.

It was one of three scenarios they ran through\u00a0Thursday inside\u00a0the vacant\u00a0Pyramid brewery on Gilman Street in West Berkeley.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of the training was to practice using verbal de-escalation tactics instead of force. It&#8217;s an approach the department already prides itself on using on a daily basis. But, as police shootings and use of force continue to draw increased scrutiny nationwide, the department says it is stepping up its efforts to ensure officers use those skills in Berkeley whenever possible.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Berkeley Police Department has a culture of de-escalation,&#8221; said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/tag\/spencer-fomby\/\">Sgt. Spencer Fomby<\/a>, a BPD use of force instructor and a leader on its tactical team. &#8220;We look at things differently. We try to take a different approach.

It\u00a0uses\u00a0the crisis intervention approach, and focuses\u00a0on specific tactics police can use to avoid using force. Fomby created the course, which has since been accepted into the state&#8217;s law enforcement training catalogue. It appears to be among the first of its kind in the system, and other departments have already expressed interest in having their officers complete it, he\u00a0said.<\/p>\n<p>Thursday, several dozen BPD officers spent the day taking\u00a0the course. After four hours in the classroom in the morning, officers broke into small teams to practice de-escalation tactics in three scenarios: a disturbance in a bar caused by a person with a sword in a mental health crisis; the aftermath of an armed bank robbery where the suspect runs\u00a0to a waiting vehicle and guns the engine; and a\u00a0domestic dispute involving roommates, where one of the roommates is\u00a0armed.<\/p>\n<p>During the morning session, Fomby described to\u00a0officers the tension between what the law allows in terms of use of force, and how some members of the public have come to see it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Even when people have firearms, they&#8217;re looking at us and telling us that we shouldn&#8217;t use force,&#8221; he told the group. &#8220;It&#8217;s a tough situation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_228347\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 720px;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-228347\" src=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/BI6A3755.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;The Berkeley Police Department has a culture of de-escalation,&quot; said Sgt.

Officers involved in fatal shootings\u00a0who are found to have acted within the law\u00a0are routinely\u00a0criticized and vilified by the public, and demands to reform modern American policing have become more and more common.<\/p>\n<p>During Thursday&#8217;s training, officers shared examples with each other of situations in their own careers where they would have been legally allowed to use deadly force, but found another way. Other examples have already made headlines in Berkeley this month, such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2016\/07\/05\/man-arrested-outside-berkeley-whole-foods-after-brandishing-knife-resisting-arrest\/\">when a man with a knife threatened Public Works employees and police<\/a>\u00a0near Whole Foods, or\u00a0when a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2016\/07\/06\/man-walking-with-loaded-rifle-extra-ammo-arrested-in-west-berkeley\/\">felon\u00a0with a loaded rifle<\/a> was walking around\u00a0West Berkeley armed with extra ammunition.<\/p>\n<p>Last week, after getting calls about a man on Adeline Street who had threatened to harm someone else, officers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2016\/07\/13\/berkeley-crime-calls-gunfire-on-stuart-battery-arrest-psych-eval\/\">talked him\u00a0into surrendering<\/a> after following him for five blocks through South Berkeley. He took off his shirt \u2014 a possible sign of agitation \u2014 and at one point picked up a stick. Ultimately, the man was detained and sent for a psychiatric evaluation and was not arrested.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8220;Lower your voice, change your demeanor, take the time to actively listen&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>Fomby \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2015\/10\/02\/25-years-later-henrys-hostage-crisis-remembered\/\">one of two team leaders<\/a> on the department&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/tag\/special-response-team\/\">Special Response Team<\/a>\u00a0(known in other departments as SWAT)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0said one of the first steps in\u00a0de-escalation is\u00a0to recognize the warning signs of agitation, such as a raised voice, balled fists or an aggressive posture. He also noted how the very presence of uniformed police, or traditional police tactics, such as the tone of\u00a0voice officers learn to use in the academy to establish &#8220;command presence&#8221; or control a scene, could increase agitation. He said officers need to try, when possible, to compensate for that.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Lower your voice, change your demeanor, take the time to actively listen,&#8221; he said, adding that he didn&#8217;t think he was telling the group anything it didn&#8217;t already know. &#8220;You guys negotiate all the time.

In February of that year, police shot a man who tried to run over an officer, crushing him between two cars. Two months later, police shot <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/tag\/calvester-stewart\/\">a murder suspect<\/a> who opened fire on officers surrounding the building he had fled into during a chase.

Photo: Emilie Raguso<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>During Thursday&#8217;s training,\u00a0officers were told to ask: Is there an immediate threat? If so, is it the suspect or the officer who is creating it?<\/p>\n<p>Officers also grappled with how best to respond to a situation where a person is suicidal and armed with a knife. Families who call 911 for help are looking for their loved one to be saved. But, for officers, the question then becomes how to effectively disarm someone with a knife without using lethal force. That question may be particularly pertinent in Berkeley because <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/tag\/tasers\/\">officers don&#8217;t have Tasers<\/a> and often\u00a0must come into close contact with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2014\/04\/10\/berkeley-police-renew-call-for-tasers-after-attempted-killing-of-officer\/\">armed, non-compliant individuals<\/a> to try to disarm them.<\/p>\n<p>There has been some discussion in Berkeley in recent years about having someone other than police be the first-responder to calls involving those in mental health crisis. Police have said it&#8217;s simply not realistic or feasible, however, to send a mental health worker alone into an environment where someone is armed and could be violent.<\/p>\n<p>Fomby said Thursday that the reality these days, based on many of the discussions taking place in the media about police use of force, is\u00a0that some members of the public would prefer police simply walk away than try to disarm someone who does not seem to be an immediate threat to others.<\/p>\n<p>He brought up the example of a call where an officer in another jurisdiction, faced with a suspect\u00a0armed with a knife, simply got into his patrol vehicle and locked the doors. In the U.K., he said, officers regularly let fleeing suspects flee.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s\u00a0better that the officer \u2026\u00a0let this person be than cause a confrontation where the suspect would\u00a0be hurt,&#8221; Fomby said, describing\u00a0the British approach. An officer asked him how the public there makes peace with the possibility that that individual might later hurt someone. Fomby said, for the most part, that isn&#8217;t a common outcome, adding: &#8220;It&#8217;s just ingrained in their culture.&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_228354\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 720px;\"><img class=\"wp-image-228354 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/BI6A3774-720x480.jpg\" alt=\"Officers respond to a domestic dispute drill involving a hostage and an armed man.

In Berkeley, the history of the city&#8217;s African American community is indelibly linked to the racist practice of redlining. At this moment of reflection about race, Berkeleyside is resurfacing this Sept. 2018 article that explores how racially discriminatory practices led, among other things, to a stark contrast between Berkeley\u2019s neighborhoods.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>During an Aug. 2 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2018\/08\/03\/the-future-of-the-ashby-bart-parking-lot-is-in-flux\">community meeting<\/a> about the future of the Ashby BART parking lot, City Councilman Ben Bartlett started the gathering by acknowledging the racialized history of the area surrounding the station. He explained that during and after WWII, black residents moved to South Berkeley in the thousands because they were excluded from most other parts of the city.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey [black residents after WWII] were cordoned off, not allowed to participate to the north, to the east, so they built their own lives, right there \u2014 shops, stores, cobblers, food, prosperity, they made history,\u201d said Bartlett.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in the 1960s, BART made plans to build an aboveground rail line along Shattuck Avenue and Adeline Street, as well as to construct the Ashby station. Local activists, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2018\/03\/21\/welcome-neighborhood-new-film-shines-light-changing-berkeley\">Mable Howard<\/a>, fought and defeated the proposal because they feared the rail line would divide the community and pollute the area. They also argued that BART would not have proposed putting in a train that divided the white community, but they had few qualms about affecting the black community.<\/p>\n<p>BART was put underground in Berkeley but it \u201cdecimated commercial zones where the people had lives,\u201d said Bartlett. Like the Fillmore District in San Francisco and the once-thriving music district along Seventh Street in Oakland, the BART construction displaced people and cultural institutions.<\/p>\n<p>Berkeley considers itself a progressive city. It was one of the first places to declare itself a nuclear-free zone, to recognize same-sex relationships, to actively desegregate its schools and to ban Styrofoam. But the history of Berkeley, like most cities across the U.S., includes using discriminatory practices to segregate the races. Those decisions, made decades, ago are still playing out today.<\/p>\n<p>One consequence of racially discriminatory practices can be seen in the stark contrast between Berkeley\u2019s neighborhoods. The difference between the large homes and winding roads of the predominantly white neighborhoods of the Hills and the Claremont neighborhood, and the modest, mixed-use character of racially diverse South and West Berkeley is indicative of the city\u2019s racial and class-based divisions. For decades, blacks and other people of color were excluded from Berkeley\u2019s more prosperous neighborhoods. They were \u201credlined.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>History of redlining in Berkeley<\/h3>\n<p>The foundation of systematic housing discrimination in the mid-20th century has an unusual source: a government agency named the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation (HOLC). President Franklin Roosevelt created HOLC in 1933, as part of the New Deal, to help homeowners who were defaulting en masse on their mortgages because of the Depression. HOLC was able to offer affordable mortgages, but to make sure borrowers wouldn\u2019t default, the agency produced maps of 250 cities around the United States between 1935 and 1940. In 1940, Congress and the president created the Federal Housing Authority (FHA), which also issued mortgages.<\/p>\n<p>HOLC\u2019s \u201csecurity maps\u201d were allegedly made to help banks assess the risk of lending money to prospective homeowners. The maps divided the cities into different grades, A = \u201cbest,\u201d B = \u201cdesirable,\u201d C = \u201cdeclining,\u201d and D = \u201chazardous\u201d signifying the level of risk of lending money to that part of the city. This system became known as \u201credlining\u201d because of its coloring of each grade, green, blue, yellow, and red; red representing the worst grade \u2013 \u201chazardous.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, in reality, these maps were used in a different way. They became a way for banks to legally discriminate against ethnic and racial minorities through selective lending practices.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA neighborhood earned a red color if African Americans lived in it, even if it was a solid middle-class neighborhood of single-family homes,\u201d Richard Rothstein wrote in <a href=\"http:\/\/books.wwnorton.com\/books\/The-Color-of-Law\/\"><em>The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Functionally, the green and blue areas of the maps indicated the white neighborhoods and the yellow and red areas indicated the neighborhoods of color. The \u201crisk\u201d was code for race and class, and thus, banks would refuse to lend money to racial minorities and people of low socioeconomic status who wanted to buy a house or start a business outside of designated neighborhoods. Often, they would refuse to lend money in the redlined neighborhoods altogether.<\/p>\n<p>The government\u2019s lender, the (FHA) also had a \u201cwhites-only\u201d requirement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRacial segregation now became an official requirement of the federal mortgage insurance program,\u201d wrote Rothstein.<\/p>\n<p>Redlining became one of the most important tools for producing racial and economic segregation and inequality in the United States. It illustrates the connection between government, systematic racism, and local policy. In effect, by keeping neighborhoods homogeneous, white property owners could protect the value of their land because other white people wanted to live in all-white neighborhoods. Moreover, redlining contained racial minorities to neighborhoods that had low property values, such as South Berkeley.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"post-aside large\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_278511\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 580px;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-278511\" src=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/ClaremontCourtGates_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/ClaremontCourtGates_01.jpg 580w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/ClaremontCourtGates_01-200x102.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/ClaremontCourtGates_01-360x184.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mason-McDuffie, developer of the Claremont district, built gates to delineate the entrance into what it named Claremont Court.

Also mixed classes of wage earners and colored professional people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the clarifying remarks, it reads, \u201cThis area of modern type bungalows was originally put on as a white subdivision. However, now Negroes have crowded in until there is only a small percentage of white remaining, mostly Italians. District known as &#8220;Negro Piedmont&#8221;. This district will never recover its original pre-Depression values\u2026 This is a high-grade Negro area and good loans can be made here if care is exercised.\u201d This type of documents guided the lending practices of cities large and small across the United States for decades.<\/p>\n<p>The FHA also discouraged banks from lending money to people buying homes in urban neighborhoods and encouraged lending in the suburbs. This led to divestment in inner city and racially mixed neighborhoods. The government also invested heavily in developing highway systems to make living in suburbs convenient. The low-cost housing and convenience to cities that suburbs offered were largely reserved for white people, segregating metropolitan areas across the country further.<\/p>\n<p>When Soskin moved to Walnut Creek with her family, they received death threats for years from the all-white surrounding community. She was prevented from insuring the building of Reid\u2019s Records in South Berkeley.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI went to the bank and they said that if I picked up the building and moved it six blocks in a direction they would insure me. There were drug dealers on every corner in those days. When Mel [her husband at the time] went to the police department to complain about the quality of policing, he was told that they like to have an area like that so when something happened in other parts of the city, they would know where to pick up the culprit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While this method was exposed and nationally outlawed in the late 1960s and 1970s by the Fair Housing Act, its legacy still lives on today. Because property, wealth, and socioeconomic status translate to wealth accumulation and similar living situations for people&#8217;s children and grandchildren. Thus, the racialized landscape of numerous cities still bears resemblance to the systematically segregated landscapes of pre-civil rights era United States.<\/p>\n<p>In the early 1960s, Berkeley was also at the forefront of the battle over fair housing. In Jan. 1963, the Berkeley City Council passed an anti-segregation law that included criminal penalties for those guilty of housing discrimination \u2013 one of the first efforts of its kind. However, the opposition was tremendous. Within months, residents opposed to the new law had gathered enough signatures to place a referendum on the April ballot. Tensions ran so high that three Berkeley High students set a cross on fire on the lawn of Fred Stripp, a liberal mayoral candidate who opposed the referendum. There was a record turnout of voters \u2014 one account said 82% of Berkeley voters went to the polls\u00a0 \u2014 and the law was repealed. The fair housing law was rescinded on the grounds that the anti-segregation law violated basic property rights and had communist influences, according to Wollenberg.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"post-aside medium\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_310055\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 420px;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-310055\" src=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Rumford.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"420\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Rumford.jpg 420w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Rumford-98x150.jpg 98w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Rumford-236x360.jpg 236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Statue of Assemblyman William Byron Rumford by Dana King.

It passed in June 1963. &#8220;Real estate interests, giddy from their victory in Berkeley, launched a statewide initiative, Proposition 14, both to repeal the Rumford act and to prohibit any state legislation outlawing housing discrimination,&#8221; W.R. Rorabaugh wrote in <a href=\"https:\/\/global.oup.com\/academic\/product\/berkeley-at-war-9780195066678?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\"><em>Berkeley at War: The 1960s.<\/em><\/a>\u00a0The measure passed, but oddly in Berkeley, it was soundly defeated. The state Supreme Court nullified Proposition 14 in 1965.<\/p>\n<p>Wollenberg described this period of Berkeley\u2019s history as a major demographic and political transformation. More and more people of color moved into the city as the more conservative white population was moving out to the suburbs. Soon, a younger generation of white people was coming in. This change in demographics led to a new liberal majority composed of liberal whites and people of color that would control Berkeley politics for decades.<\/p>\n<p>For most, homeownership is the most important form of wealth building. Access to Berkeley\u2019s housing market has been the source of wealth and social mobility for a generation of working-class and middle-class residents who have seen their property value increase immensely in just a few decades. According to Zillow, home values have essentially doubled in only the last 10 years (not adjusted for inflation).<\/p>\n<p>Such is the significance of redlining and other exclusionary housing policies in the racial wealth gap. Generations of white people were allowed access to wealth building through homeownership of valuable property, while the same was actively denied to people of color.<\/p>\n<h3>The story today<\/h3>\n<p>Today, explicit or veiled housing discrimination is illegal. Yet, the structural patterns persist. MLK and Dwight Way remain important lines dividing racial and economic difference, albeit far blurrier than in the past. Those areas that were labeled desirable on the HOLC maps remain the most sought-after real estate in Berkeley, the wealthiest, and the whitest. Berkeley\u2019s distinctive distribution of real estate value, in part created through the systematically racist local and national housing policy in the 20th century, is much the same today.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pullquote\">\n<p>\u201cThere is a wholeness and cultural richness that is lost when we attempt to homogenize who we are.\u201d<br \/>\n\u2014 Betty Reid Soskin<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>The current affordable housing crisis has created a high demand for housing in the neighborhoods that were described as \u201cdeclining\u201d or \u201chazardous.\u201d When Berkeley established zoning regulations in 1916, it permitted apartment complexes in those areas, while requiring that only single-family homes be built in the wealthier districts.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, now they are even out of reach for most working-class buyers and renters. While before, for the most part, \u201cundesirable\u201d people were excluded from certain parts of the city and welcomed in others, today those who cannot afford the soaring housing costs in Berkeley are excluded completely.<\/p>\n<p>These rising costs have led to increasing displacement of African Americans and people of color, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbandisplacement.org\/research\">according to a new study<\/a> by the Urban Displacement Project at UC Berkeley and the California Housing Partnership. As prices soared between 2000 and 2015, many black residents and others moved out of the Berkeley flatlands to more affordable areas, such as Antioch or areas of southern Alameda County, according to the report. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Berkeley-displacement.pdf\">That exodus created new poverty pockets<\/a> and areas of racial segregation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a wholeness and cultural richness that is lost when we attempt to homogenize who we are,\u201d said Soskin, who fled to Richmond from Walnut Creek because she found the predominately white city \u201cculturally deprived.\u201d \u201cIf it disappears I will move again\u2026 There is a lot that gets lost with gentrification and redlining, things that are really the essence of what makes this country great.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Jesse Barber is a lifetime Berkeley resident.

Introduced at Wednesday night&#8217;s school board meeting, the legislation also calls for a \u201ccommunity-driven process\u201d including students, teachers, principals, other district staff and community members to work together to develop a new safety plan for schools. The board will vote on this resolution at its June 24 meeting.<\/p>\n<p>Also at Wednesday night\u2019s school board meeting, Superintendent Kyla Johnson-Trammell shared an outline for how OUSD could transition to police-free schools by December 2020 and redirect funding to social workers and restorative justice coordinators instead.<\/p>\n<p>Several school board members have shifted their thinking in recent weeks about the issue. Board president Jody London and Director Gary Yee, who both voted against a measure in March to eliminate three OUSD police officers, both signaled their support for the superintendent\u2019s plan, all but ensuring it will pass in two weeks with a majority.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy own initial instinct around the safety plan and defunding of police is really to look at physical safety,\u201d Yee said. \u201cThanks to the Black Organizing Project and hundreds of thousands of emails and phone calls I\u2019ve had, [and] the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BlackOrgProject\/photos\/a.3248229631864421\/3248229768531074\/\">demonstration at my house on Friday<\/a>, I\u2019ve come to realize how short-sighted I was, and the blindness I had focusing on physical safety. I blocked out the importance of social-emotional and trauma-informed safety.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m prepared to reimagine that system,\u201d Yee added.<\/p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2020\/06\/05\/for-9-years-the-black-organizing-project-has-been-campaigning-to-remove-police-from-oakland-schools-will-it-finally-happen\">we reported<\/a> last week, Oakland activists have been pressuring the district for years to eliminate its police department and focus on peace-keeping instead of security.<\/p>\n<p>During the meeting, which was held on Zoom, dozens of community members and teachers provided comments, with the vast majority in support of the resolution. Few students spoke, but among them was Xiomara Mendoza Najera, a third-grader at Think College Now elementary school.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am tired of black and brown people getting killed by the police. I am brown and my skin is beautiful,\u201d Najera said. \u201cI don\u2019t need police in my school. I need my teachers, my coaches and my principals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>School board director Jumoke Hinton-Hodge, who has been the most outspoken opponent of the renewed push to remove the OUSD police force, did not voice her opinion on the resolution during the meeting. In an interview with The Oaklandside, Hinton-Hodge stressed that removing police from schools won\u2019t stop teachers from calling the police on students in lieu of other options, and won\u2019t fix racial disparities regarding <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publiccounsel.org\/tools\/assets\/files\/0436.pdf\">who is referred to police<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLet this resolution be the beginning of a dedication to harder work around anti-racism,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe for the safety of our kids, I think we have to build some skill to do this kind of work around race and violence in our community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hinton-Hodge said she believes the Oakland school officers are specially equipped to handle youth. If school police were eliminated and regular Oakland Police Department officers begin responding to school calls, as would happen if the resolution passes, Hinton-Hodge worries that those officers may not have adequate training to respond to youth in crisis.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think that it is disingenuous to sit here and think that OPD is going to show up with the same kind of compassion and the same kind of understanding about what is happening with our teachers and what is happening with our systems,\u201d Hinton-Hodge said at the March 4 school board meeting.<\/p>\n<p>Of the dozens of public comments shared at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, just one person was not in support of the resolution. They also raised concerns about whether OPD could handle the influx of calls from Oakland schools.<\/p>\n<p>Between June 2019 and January 2020, Oakland school police received just over 1,000 calls, mainly from campus administrators like principals. A couple hundred of those were \u201cpriority calls,\u201d which include violent crime, property crime and crimes against children. During that six-month period, OUSD police <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ousd.org\/cms\/lib\/CA01001176\/Centricity\/Domain\/123\/Board%20Policy%205145.14%20Data%20Tracking%206-2019%20to%2001-20.pdf\">arrested three students<\/a> in separate incidents for carrying a concealed weapon, rape, and battery.<\/p>\n<p>At Wednesday night\u2019s meeting, Superintendent Johnson-Trammell emphasized that the creation of the safety plan would also have to involve the labor unions that represent the officers. Janell Hampton, a representative for the California School Employees Association, which represents the seven sworn non-managerial school officers, underscored the importance of involving the officers in conversations about revised safety plans. OUSD officers see themselves as a valuable part of the district and want to continue serving, Hampton said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOUSD students cannot be left in the lurch with sweeping changes that try to happen overnight based on a plan that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>The Black Organizing Project, an activist organization of Black Oaklanders working towards racial justice, has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2020\/06\/05\/for-9-years-the-black-organizing-project-has-been-campaigning-to-remove-police-from-oakland-schools-will-it-finally-happen\">pressuring the district for years<\/a> to eliminate its police department. The campaign, which has received support from students, parents, community members and the teachers union, began in 2011, following <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eastbayexpress.com\/oakland\/the-mother-and-the-officer\/Content?oid=9976630\">the killing of Raheim Brown<\/a> by an Oakland schools police sergeant. Two sergeants patrolling near Skyline High School approached Brown, then 20, and a friend sitting in a car near the school. An altercation ensued and a sergeant fired several rounds into the car, killing Brown.<\/p>\n<p>In the years since, activists have challenged the necessity of the department, pointing to other controversies involving Oakland school police. In the fall of 2011, the police chief, Pete Sarna, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/bayarea\/article\/Oakland-schools-top-cop-quits-over-slurs-2334944.php\">resigned after making racist remarks<\/a>, including slurs, towards other officers.<\/p>\n<p>In a 2016 incident at Fremont High School, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kqed.org\/news\/10465826\/violent-incident-at-high-school-in-oakland-raises-new-questions-about-security-officers\">school security officers choked and dragged<\/a> 15-year-old Jonathan Rodriguez, a special education student, during an altercation caught on video.<\/p>\n<p>And in October 2019, 30 sworn police and security officers monitored a school board meeting they anticipated would be disrupted by teachers and parents speaking out against school closures. During the demonstration, the officers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kqed.org\/news\/11781890\/parent-protests-against-school-closures-turn-violent-at-oakland-school-board-meeting\">drew batons against the crowd<\/a> and arrested six people.<\/p>\n<p>During the next regular school board meeting, board directors will debate and vote on the resolution, including any amendments other members may propose.

In advance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/391011254354978\/posts\/3131953580260718\/\">she announced<\/a> that she and interim Oakland Police Chief Susan Manheimer are proposing to ban the use of carotid chokeholds by officers. A carotid hold blocks the flow of blood to the brain and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ktvu.com\/news\/california-governor-calls-for-end-to-carotid-chokehold\">can result in death<\/a>. Currently, Oakland police are allowed to use carotid holds.<\/p>\n<p>Like other recent protests, safety was a concern for organizers on Wednesday. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CBQ1IMkA9g9\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">flyer<\/a> distributed online said masks were mandatory. Organizers passed out water and snacks to the crowd. One speaker acknowledged the difficulty of social distancing during a protest, but felt that it was necessary to show up in numbers. \u201cBlack lives have been experiencing a pandemic for centuries, and that is police brutality,\u201d they said.<\/p>\n<p>After an hour of impassioned speeches in the Walgreens parking lot on Foothill Blvd., a large flatbed truck pulled onto Fruitvale Avenue and led the march. Protestors danced up Fruitvale to the sound of hyphy music. As the march passed the Krispy Krunchy Chicken on Fruitvale and Blossom Street, they were greeted by a group of drummers playing in solidarity.<\/p>\n<p>Police presence at the march was minimal. A small number of CHP officers equipped with face shields and batons stood at the entrance to Interstate 580.<\/p>\n<p>Outside Schaaf\u2019s home, the protesters held a minute of silence and then shouted the names of people killed by police. Schaaf did not make an appearance nor directly address the protestors.<\/p>\n<p>Speakers called for the defunding of local police, but spent a bulk of the time addressing the crowd on their desire to remove police presence from OUSD schools. While the march was underway, the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ashleynmcb\/status\/1270908176272109570\">Oakland Unified School District<\/a> board was meeting and considering a resolution that would disband their police department, the aim of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2020\/06\/05\/for-9-years-the-black-organizing-project-has-been-campaigning-to-remove-police-from-oakland-schools-will-it-finally-happen\">a nine-year campaign<\/a> led by the Black Organizing Project to dramatically reform school-safety programs.<\/p>\n<p>Gene Hazzard, who has lived in Oakland since the 1970\u2019s and took part in Wednesday night\u2019s rally, said he was moved to see so many people in the streets. \u201cThis is the first time I can see some meaningful structural change,\u201d Hazzard said.<\/p>\n<p>Outside the mayor\u2019s home, protestors lit candles and held up their cellphones in one more moment of silence before leaving the normally quiet residential street around 9:20 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>As the demonstration came to a close, some protestors left signs that read \u201cDefund OPD\u201d on Schaaf\u2019s lawn. Tupac Shakur\u2019s song \u201cChanges\u201d played from a sound system as a few hundred people made the long trek down the hill back to Fruitvale.<\/p>\n","id":378244},{"info":"Oakland news","date":"2020-06-11T16:49:33","link":"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2020\/06\/11\/oaklands-old-lake-merritt-lodge-will-become-a-covid-19-homeless-shelter","title":"Oakland&#8217;s old Lake Merritt Lodge will become a COVID-19 homeless shelter","image":"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3-400x400.jpg","large_image":"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3-720x540.jpg","author":{"name":"Natalie Orenstein","link":"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/author\/natalie"},"comments":"1","excerpt":"Advocates hope Alameda County will buy other empty buildings to become housing for unsheltered Oaklanders, too.   \n","content":"<figure id=\"attachment_378192\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 720px;\"><img class=\"wp-image-378192 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3-720x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3-720x540.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3-360x270.jpg 360w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3-200x150.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3-632x474.jpg 632w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3-536x402.jpg 536w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Harrison-Street-3.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The historic building on Harrison Street and Grand Avenue is slated to become a homeless shelter during the pandemic. Photo: Natalie Orenstein<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The pale yellow six-story building at Harrison Street and Grand Avenue, by Lake Merritt, has housed an eclectic array of tenants over the last hundred years.<\/p>\n<p>Starting in the 1920s, it was a <a href=\"https:\/\/localwiki.org\/oakland\/YWCA_Blue_Triangle_Club\">YWCA boarding house<\/a> for \u201cyoung working girls.\u201d Later, it became a single-room-occupancy hotel called the Lake Merritt Lodge. Until last year, it was a dorm for international business school students who were shuttled to and from San Francisco on buses and limos.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Alameda County is stepping in to purchase the property, along with a neighboring office building and parking lot, turning the site into a shelter for medically fragile homeless people during the coronavirus pandemic. The old lodge\u2019s 92 rooms will be offered to individuals who don\u2019t have COVID-19 symptoms but do have higher risks, like older adults or people with asthma or heart disease.<\/p>\n<p>The sale comes as local advocates and officials are considering how to turn coronavirus emergency measures into programs that can support vulnerable residents beyond the pandemic. In April, the county and state started leasing hotel rooms through Project Roomkey, a state-funded program to get people off the streets during the crisis. But the temporary leases for these hotels, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2020\/04\/15\/alameda-county-hopes-to-avoid-repeat-of-san-franciscos-homeless-shelter-covid-19-outbreak\">including three in Oakland<\/a>, won\u2019t help their current guests in the long run, Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson noted at a board meeting on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>At that meeting, without any discussion or fanfare, the county Board of Supervisors unanimously approved spending $23.3 million to purchase the former Lake Merritt Lodge with state and federal COVID-19 funding. According to a county staff report, residents would have access to on-site housing counselors, and behavioral health and substance use services.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe decided to sell it to the county because they informed us they were going to use the building for the unsheltered,\u201d said the building\u2019s current owner, South Bay real estate developer Mahnaz Khazen. The county was already in talks with Khazen to buy the property before the pandemic, for use as a residential program for women and children. According to a county staff report, \u201cthese negotiations came to a stalemate over price.\u201d Khazen reportedly asked for $31 million at the time.<\/p>\n<p>The report attributes the eventual deal to the current downturn of the hotel market. Khazen said, however, that she turned down several other offers besides the county\u2019s. \u201cWe wanted to do something good and give back \u2014 we enjoyed being in Oakland,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>The building was used as an SRO-type hotel, under the names Lake Merritt Lodge and Merritt Hotel, for some decades before Khazen purchased the property in 2013 in a foreclosure auction. The historic property had \u201cdecayed\u201d into \u201ca disaster,\u201d said Khazen, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eastbaytimes.com\/2014\/09\/10\/oakland-former-lake-merritt-lodge-to-house-international-students\/\">who poured money into renovations<\/a>, reconstructing chandeliers to match old photographs she found of the original fixtures. She eventually rented it out as a student dorm for the Hult International Business School, which gave up its lease in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Naomi Schiff, an advocate for Oakland\u2019s homeless community with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shelteroak.org\/\">ShelterOak<\/a>, lives close to 2332 Harrison St. She and others have been \u201cagitating\u201d for the county to buy the property for at least a year, pressuring supervisors to pursue the purchase, she said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI noticed that one day they took the Hult name off the building. I kept my eye on it and realized it wasn\u2019t coming back, so I started to think, well, this could be used for people who need housing,\u201d said Schiff. Since affordable housing is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/homeless-housing\/story\/2020-04-09\/california-low-income-housing-expensive-apartment-coronavirus\">so expensive to build new<\/a>, Schiff said governments should try to scoop up existing buildings.<\/p>\n<p>Schiff\u2019s organization is scouting other vacant properties it thinks the county could buy. She said there\u2019s a double opportunity now to address COVID-19 needs and create future affordable housing. Gov. Gavin Newsom has also suggested that counties could use remaining federal coronavirus funds <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/states\/california\/story\/2020\/06\/03\/is-hotel-california-a-permanent-answer-to-homelessness-1288189\">to buy hotels, not just rent them<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe know we have an enormous need, and not that many projects in the pipeline to build affordable housing,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cEvery little scrap would be great. We have all these people under the freeway.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>People live in tents on the grass next to 2332 Harrison St., too. Among them is Nabou Dnaba, who said he\u2019d be happy to see the big yellow building turn into a shelter.<\/p>\n<p>Dnaba said he\u2019s been living in tents in Oakland for four years, switching locations each time the police tell him to leave. He said they\u2019ve come around recently, too, asking him and his neighbors to pack up.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe said no \u2014 before you close this you need to get us some housing,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The county hasn\u2019t specified how residents will be selected to live in the old lodge, but typically a set of approved social services agencies can refer eligible guests to Project Roomkey hotels.<\/p>\n<p>County staffers noted in their report that the cost of the shelter program is the same whether it\u2019s run out of a publicly owned building or a leased hotel. But operational costs will be lower at 2332 Harrison St. than at a hotel, saving the county $1.2 million a year. During Tuesday\u2019s Board of Supervisors meeting, Carson, the vice president of the board, said the county should think carefully about how to spend its remaining federal coronavirus funds, and focus on unsheltered and other vulnerable populations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt some point we\u2019re going to run out of money on the [hotel] leases, and we\u2019re going to have to make a decision on where people go. Some have been released, some into shelters. Very few have found long-term housing \u2014 there have been people who\u2019ve returned back to the streets,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The Oaklandside contacted Carson to ask whether the board is looking into buying any other hotel buildings, but did not hear back.<\/p>\n<p>The county said the old lodge will be ready for use, pending potential \u201ctenant improvements,\u201d once the sale closes.<\/p>\n","id":378189},{"info":"Community","date":"2020-06-11T15:34:00","link":"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2020\/06\/11\/the-sit-list-5-things-to-do-while-waiting-out-lockdown","title":"The Sit List: 5 things to do while waiting out lockdown","image":"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Dog-and-Cat-together-scaled-e1588793238449-1536x803-1-400x400.jpg","large_image":"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Dog-and-Cat-together-scaled-e1588793238449-1536x803-1-720x376.jpg","author":{"name":"Minhae Shim Roth","link":"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/author\/minhae-shim-roth"},"comments":"4","excerpt":"Go on a date night at Hotsy Totsy Club to support Berkeley Humane; take a cooking lesson with local chefs; put on a play at home \u2014 plus more ideas.\n","content":"<figure id=\"attachment_378223\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 720px;\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-378223\" src=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Dog-and-Cat-together-scaled-e1588793238449-1536x803-1-720x376.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Dog-and-Cat-together-scaled-e1588793238449-1536x803-1-720x376.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Dog-and-Cat-together-scaled-e1588793238449-1536x803-1-360x188.jpg 360w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Dog-and-Cat-together-scaled-e1588793238449-1536x803-1-200x105.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Dog-and-Cat-together-scaled-e1588793238449-1536x803-1-768x402.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Dog-and-Cat-together-scaled-e1588793238449-1536x803-1.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo: Courtesy Berkeley Humane<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>PET &amp; SIP: DATE NIGHT TO HELP BERKELEY HUMANE<\/strong> Who doesn\u2019t want to help adorable pets in need? <a href=\"https:\/\/berkeleyhumane.org\/\">Berkeley Humane<\/a>\u00a0is throwing a special <a href=\"https:\/\/one.bidpal.net\/bhdatenight\/welcome\">Date Night evening fundraiser<\/a> hosted by the Hotsy Totsy Club to help save the lives of shelter animals.

Photo: Courtesy of Chidera Anyanwu<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/aside>\n<p>Traditionally, <em>puff-puffs<\/em> are made with five ingredients (flour, yeast, water, sugar and salt); six, if you include the vegetable oil they&#8217;re deep-fried in, but Anyanwu said there&#8217;s a lot more that goes into mixing the ingredients together and frying them in oil.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more of an art to making puffs than people realize,&#8221; Anyanwu said. &#8220;Trust me, it took my mom years to figure out how to perfectly make them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>Puff-puffs<\/em> can be enjoyed as snacks or as a side with savory meals. They often make appearances at parties. Anyanwu said, you&#8217;ll regularly see them at Nigerian weddings and other celebratory events.<\/p>\n<p>Using her mother&#8217;s base, but adding her own twist (&#8220;mine are lighter than hers&#8221;), Anyanwu started making <em>puff-puffs<\/em> for friends&#8217; parties. Diverging from tradition, she made variations with gooey caramel or creamy Nutella piped inside, rolled in cinnamon-sugar, or dusted with powdered sugar. She started getting enough requests for her <em>puff-puffs <\/em>that, this April, Anyanwu decided to officially start Gourmet Puff.<\/p>\n<p>For now, Gourmet Puff is a side business for Anyanwu, who spends the rest of her day as a trademark, copyright and advertising lawyer. Her law job is pretty flexible, meaning, she can break up her hours between mornings and evenings, leaving afternoons free for baking and delivery of her product<em>s<\/em>. Anyanwu makes the pastries at her Oakland home&#8217;s kitchen, which is licensed for a cottage food operation. With Gourmet Puff just two months&#8217; old, Anyawu and her husband, Bayo, do all the deliveries, but she said she will soon have DoorDash and Grubhub fulfilling orders.<\/p>\n<p>Anyanwu said she plans to offer more flavors over time including savory <em>puff-puffs<\/em> stuffed with Nigerian red stew and <em>efo <\/em>(stewed spinach). As far as she knows, Gourmet Puff is the only local business specializing primarily in <em>puff-puffs<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Anyanwu and her husband moved to Oakland from Washington, D.C., where there is a larger African community, and consequently, more pan-African food options. Oakland, in comparison, has a sparse selection, with only one Nigerian restaurant \u2014 Ruth&#8217;s Buka (the other, Miliki, recently closed). Anyanwu said she saw an opportunity to introduce her new community to her culture through <em>puff-puffs<\/em>, something that most Nigerian restaurants serve, but mostly as a side. Anyanwu feels they deserve a moment in the spotlight.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Puff-puffs<\/em> are treated like the stepchild of the meal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They should be the meal, the highlight.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Because they&#8217;re still not well-known among non-Africans, Anyanwu said one of the hardest parts of running Gourmet Puff is describing what <em>puff-puffs<\/em> are to those who&#8217;ve never had them before. She said some people have compared them to mochi, because of their chewy texture, and, because they&#8217;re deep-fried dough balls and look the part, there&#8217;s a tendency to compare <em>puff-puffs<\/em> to donuts \u2013 but Anyanwu doesn&#8217;t agree.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a fan of donuts,&#8221; Anyawu said. &#8220;Donuts taste like sugar air, they don&#8217;t have the substance I want.&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_378169\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 720px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/2020\/06\/11\/puff-puffs-are-nigerian-fried-chewy-pastries-you-need-to-try-right-now\/gourmet-puff-party\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-378169\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-378169\" src=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-720x540.jpg\" alt=\"A variety pack box of Gourmet Puff puff-puffs. \" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-720x540.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-360x270.jpg 360w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-200x150.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-1376x1032.jpg 1376w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-1044x783.jpg 1044w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-632x474.jpg 632w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-536x402.jpg 536w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Gourmet-Puff-Party.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gourmet Puff&#8217;s &#8220;Puff Party,&#8221; a variety pack featuring five flavors.

The film will also be available on-demand beginning July 10.<\/p>\n<p>Adapted by Frank Cottrell Boyce from his short story \u2018Triple Word Score,\u2019 <em>Sometimes Always Never<\/em> stars Bill Nighy as Alan, a tailor whose eldest son Michael has been missing for years. Michael\u2019s brother Peter (Sam Riley, best known for his memorable performable as Joy Division singer Ian Curtis in 2007\u2019s <em>Control<\/em>) resents his sibling&#8217;s status as prodigal son, but grudgingly agrees to drive Dad around when a new lead emerges.<\/p>\n<p>Spending the night at a seaside hotel, Alan has an opportunity to engage in his other obsession: Scrabble. Finding a set in the hotel lobby, he challenges two other guests to a game, wryly observing that \u201cthe only good thing about jazz is it scores very high in Scrabble.\u201d Reminding Dad that there\u2019s only one \u2018z\u2019 per set, Peter not so subtly suggests his father might sometimes keep an extra letter up his sleeve.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sometimes Always Never<\/em> is, of course, more about Peter and Alan\u2019s frayed relationship than it is about their search for Michael. Liverpudlian Boyce is one of Britain\u2019s best film writers, and his witty screenplay reflects his Merseyside background: dry and self-deprecating. <em>Sometimes Always Never&#8217;<\/em>s sharply drawn depiction of contentious family matters steers well clear of the mawkish sentimentality a similar Hollywood production would fall back on.<\/p>\n<p>Set in northwest England (the best part of the country, as most sensible people agree), the film also marks the directorial debut of Carl Hunter, a Bootle boy Americans may remember from his time playing bass for The Farm on their massive 1990 hit \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iRgtzZ-mOQo\">All Together Now<\/a>\u2019. Connections to late 20th-century pop culture don\u2019t stop there, however: former Orange Juice frontman Edwyn Collins (\u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6oqJ0JpMj6I\">A Girl Like You<\/a>\u2019) contributed the film\u2019s score and title tune, while Marxist comedian <a href=\"https:\/\/theartsdesk.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/M_images\/alexei%20young.jpg\">Alexei Sayle<\/a> (\u2018The Young Ones\u2019) pops up for a third-act cameo.<\/p>\n<p>Cinematographer Richard Stoddard, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t feel obliged to wobble (or even move) his camera unless the story actually requires it (regular readers may recall my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berkeleyside.com\/search\/john+seal+shaky-cam\">occasional rants about shaky-cam<\/a> over the years). I have no idea why this excellent film didn\u2019t previously warrant an American theatrical release, but put that aside: it\u2019s here now, and if you\u2019re looking for an intelligently written and heartwarming comedy-drama, <em>Sometimes Always Never<\/em> comes up aces.<\/p>\n<h3>Two excellent freebies to watch: &#8216;The Black Panthers&#8217; and &#8216;Too Late for Tears&#8217;<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re pinching your pennies, there are a couple of excellent freebies available this week, including Agn\u00e8s Varda\u2019s 1968 documentary <em>The Black Panthers<\/em>, currently streaming <em>gratis<\/em> on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.criterionchannel.com\/black-panthers\/videos\/black-panthers\">Criterion Channel<\/a> (note: the link works well in Safari, but doesn&#8217;t seem to work in Firefox).
